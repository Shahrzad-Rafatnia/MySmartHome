## Resident Homepage<br>
![Resident Homepage](Storyboards/smarthome-resident-homepage.png)

The homepage is what the resident sees when he logs in.  It will display his/her current ranking, recently achieved badges, and current statistics of his house (as current as the data can show).

## Resident Achievements<br>
![Resident Achievements](Storyboards/smarthome-resident-achievements.png)

Resident achievements will be shown in a grid.  Placing the mouse over each achievement should show information about the achievement (such as how the achievement can be achieved, and the "achieved date" for achievements the resident has achieved).

## Resident Scoreboard<br>
![Resident Scoreboard](Storyboards/smarthome-resident-scoreboard.png)

The scoreboard will show the residents' scores (but names will not be shown for privacy purposes), and their rank.  The current resident who is logged in and viewing the scoreboard will see his/her row highlighted on this table.  He/she may also view the ranking on a bar graph.

## Resident Advice<br>
![Resident Advice](Storyboards/smarthome-resident-suggestions.png)

Based on the resident's scores, achievements, and statistics, this page will generate personalized advice for the resident to help him/her improve his score.

## Resident History<br>
![Resident History](Storyboards/smarthome-resident-history.png)

The resident will be able to see a history of his statistics by giving some options, such as what statistic to view, in what form, for what time period.  This will be very similar to the engineers' search view.
