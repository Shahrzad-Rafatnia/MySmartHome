## Project Overview
Our client ([WBHDC](http://www.wbhadc.ca/)) produces affordable apartments for low-income tenants. To this end, they would like to know how to maximize the efficiency of operating these apartments. They are currently tracking metrics such as heat lost through certain walls, heating required, and electricity consumed by the different appliances in each apartment. Identifying inefficiencies in these apartments will assist the engineers in constructing more efficient housing in the future; further, identifying what aspects of maintenance are most expensive will assist the building managers in planning, budgeting, and incentivizing tenants to reduce costs in these areas. Tenants may also be interested to see where and why they are spending the most money on heating and electricity. However, the current visualization of this data is insufficient for the needs of any of these stakeholders. Developing custom visualizations so that each of these stakeholders can quickly extract the information they are interested will make this job easier to perform and perhaps assist in future development of low-income housing.

## Requirements

**Overview**  
For this first pass, I have followed the Volere template for requirement analysis. I have devised the following list of requirement types and use cases. In general, cuts to requirements of categories 1, 2, or 3 indicate a failure to deliver the system as promised. I have allowed multiple use cases for a single requirement as different users will have different use cases but similar requirements.

 	
**Requirement Types**   	
- 1. System – These are back-end requirements which are necessary for the completion of the project. As they are the most likely candidates for bottlenecking our system development, they should be our first priority.
- 2. Mandatory – We cannot consider the project to be completed in any sense without fulfilling these requirements for the user.
- 3. Flexible – We must have something approximately equivalent to this requirement to consider the project completed, but the details need not be exactly as described. 	
- 4. Polish – While not strictly necessary for completion of this project, these requirements will add significant quality to our project and should be considered part of our deliverables unless the project falls well behind schedule.	 	
- 5. Optional – While desirable, these requirements can be cut if time is running low.

**Requirement Name:** Data Selection  
**Requirement #:** 1 	**Requirement Type:** 2	**Use Cases:** 2.1, 3.1

**Description:** The product will allow building managers and engineers to select what types of data they are interested in, and how they would like that data displayed.

**Rationale:** Building managers and engineers should be permitted access to all of the same data, as it is possible that either may be interested in data that is “usually” the domain of the other. However, providing all this data at once is not feasible. A system must exist to act as the “controller” for our product, and allow the user to choose what data they would like to see, and how they would like to see it.

**Fit Criterion:** The user will be able to provide as input to the product any collection of apartments outfitted with sensors and a time period, as well as visualization options and optional information such as financial analysis, efficiency analysis,  (either through a dropdown menu or by selecting a different search form). The product will then return the aggregate and average data as appropriate for the selected sensors, in the selected apartments, displayed in the selected format. In short, our system must be flexible in what data it displays, and how it displays it.

**Requirement Name:** Report Generation  
**Requirement #:** 2 	**Requirement Type:** 2	**Use Cases:** 2.2, 3.1

**Description:**  The product will produce plaintext reports, based on selection options, of sensor data for a given apartment.

**Rationale:** The raw numbers and data collected by the sensor are too numerous and small to be of use to any of our stakeholders. The aggregate data must be available in plaintext for use in stakeholder databases, reports, etc.

**Fit Criterion:**  When provided an apartment and time period by the user, the product will return, in plaintext, the aggregate and average data (as appropriate) for the selected apartment in the selected time period.

**Customer Satisfaction:** 3		**Customer Dissatisfaction:** 10  
**Dependencies:** 3			**Conflicts:** None

**Requirement Name:** Data Processing  
**Requirement #:** 3 	**Requirement Type:** 1	**Use Cases:**   

**Description:** Database access and calculations will be handled by a page completely separate from the front-end pages.

**Rationale:** To facilitate a flexible design, the clients have requested that our data-level protocols be kept separate from the display of these protocols.

**Fit Criterion:** Whenever database access or calculations on this data (i.e., calculation of efficiency coefficients for heat loss) must be performed, this data will be sent from the front-end page to a different page which will do all calculations. This page will perform all necessary calculations and return the data to the front-end of the system, which will be responsible for the display of this data.

**Requirement Name:** Visualization Options  
**Requirement #:** 4	**Requirement Type:** 1	**Use Cases:** 2.1, 2.3, 3.1, 4.4, 4.5 

**Description:** Data must be presented in some visual format: i.e. interactive graphs.

**Rationale:** While plaintext data is valuable for certain tasks, graphs and charts are easier to digest at a glance.

**Fit Criterion:** Whenever a user requests data from the system, they should have the choice of different visual formats.

**Requirement Name:**  Apartment View  
**Requirement #:** 5 	**Requirement Type:** 2	**Use Cases:** 2.1, 3.1, 4.4, 4.5

**Description:** Data should be presented overlaid over the floor plan of the apartment from which the data was collected.

**Rationale:** Being able to glance at the floor plan of an apartment and immediately identify the areas of high and low energy loss will greatly simplify the work of the building manager and engineers, who are both interested in tracking down problem spots throughout the apartments.

**Fit Criterion:** Whenever a user requests data from the system, they should have the option to select Apartment View. This view should cause data to be represented in some fashion (dots, color-coded) as an overlay on the floor plan of the selected apartments.

**Requirement Name:**  Graph View  
**Requirement #:** 6 	**Requirement Type:** 1	**Use Cases:** 2.1, 3.1, 4.4, 4.5

**Description:** Data must be presented in some visual format: i.e. interactive graphs.

**Rationale:** While plaintext data is valuable for certain tasks, graphs and charts are easier to digest at a glance.

**Fit Criterion:** Whenever a user requests data from the system, they should have the option of selecting from one or more Graph Views. These views will display the data in some visual format, such as a bar chart, pie chart, or line chart (where appropriate).

**Requirement Name:** Chart/Graph Visualization  
**Requirement #:** 7	**Requirement Type:** 1	**Use Cases:** 2.1, 3.1, 4.4, 4.5

**Description:** Data must be presented in some visual format: i.e. interactive graphs.

**Rationale:** To facilitate a flexible design, the clients have requested that our data-level protocols be kept separate from the display of these protocols.

**Fit Criterion:** Whenever database access or calculations on this data (i.e., calculation of efficiency coefficients for heat loss) must be performed, this data will be sent from the front-end page to the back-end web service through an http request. This service will perform all necessary calculations and return the data to the front-end of the system, which will be responsible for the display of this data.

**Requirement Name:** Weather Data

**Requirement #:** 8 	**Requirement Type:** 5	**Use Cases:**

**Description:** Data is parsed from Environment Canada or a similar website, and presented side-by-side with sensor data.

**Rationale:** Heat loss and heating data is more useful within the context of that day's weather.

**Fit Criterion:** When selecting sensor data and apartments, the user should have the option of displaying the average daily temperature (alternatively, the daily high and daily low temperature) for that day, in addition to the other requested information.

**Customer Satisfaction:** 4		**Customer Dissatisfaction:** 3

**Requirement Name:** Floor Plan Selection

**Requirement #:** 9  **Requirement Type:** 2	**Use Cases:**

**Description:** A list of floor plans will have to be maintainable, as apartments with new floor plans may be added to the system.

**Rationale:** If this system is extended to include more apartments, the floor plans of these new apartments must be supported.

**Fit Criterion:** The system will allow users to upload new floor plans for use in the system, whether through an upload tool or API.

* **Resident:** A resident at the [Stony Mountain Plaza] interested in using sensor data to reduce their bills and environmental impact.
* **Engineer:** A construction or research engineer.
* **Research engineer:** A privileged user interested in using sensor data to evaluate sustainability issues (ex. analyzing the sustainability of the building's solar/geothermal/natgas energy setup.) 
* **Construction Engineer:** A privileged user interested in analyzing sensor data to improve the physical design of the building (ex. wall thickness, insulation, and stud placement).
* **Privileged user:** A user with access to all sensor data.

**Resident Terms**
* **Achievement:** A sustainability goal achievable by residents to improve their score and flaunt status.
* **Sustainability Goal:** A goal based on reducing the consumption of utilities indicated by sensor data.

## Competing Products

####[Honeywell Attune](https://buildingsolutions.honeywell.com/HBSCDMS/attune/)
**Overview**  
Honeywell Attune offers services to help building managers improve the efficiency of their buildings. Attune provides an [Energy Awareness Dashboard](https://buildingsolutions.honeywell.com/HBSCDMS/attune/css/images/popup-image02.jpg) that gives building managers easy access to information collected from their buildings, such as utility usage and cost. Attune also provides benchmarks, recommendations, and diagnostics for analyzing the sustainability and financial cost of the building.

**Analysis**  
Attune appears to be geared towards building managers, providing only aggregate information about the building. It does not appear to provide access to data on a room by room basis, and does not seem to support multiple types of users. The benchmarks, recommendations, and diagnostics it provide are interesting, but beyond the scope of our project.

####[DGLux](http://www.dglogik.com/dglux/features/overview)
**Overview**  
> DGLux is a "drag & drop" visualization platform that enables you to design real-time, data-driven applications and dashboards without ever writing a single line of code.

**Analysis**  
DGLux is solely a visualization platform. Its method of binding data to widgets appears very flexible. It is even possible to [visualize data on an image of a floorplan](http://www.dglogik.com/dgnews/company-news/117-zone-temperature-overlays-tutorial). DGLux works on mobile platforms as well. If it were possible, it would work great as a visualization component inside of our web application.

####[Lucid Building Dashboard](http://www.luciddesigngroup.com/products.php)
**Overview**  
Lucid Building Dashboard is used in many large buildings across North America (see http://www.luciddesigngroup.com/customers.php). The dashboard provides graphs and breakdowns of utility usage and cost by floor and end use. It allows users to compare their usage information with other users in the Dashboard Network, and is integrated with social networking sites. Lucid keeps their user base involved by hosting competitions and awarding medals. Lucid also provides a "Kiosk" version of the dashboard that can be used in public places.

**Analysis**  
With there large user base, there is no doubt they are doing something right. While the dashboard looks perfect for our building manager and resident users, it does not appear flexible enough to handle our engineer requirements, as the visualizations it provides are too basic. Nonetheless, we should take some notes from their design for our resident pages.
