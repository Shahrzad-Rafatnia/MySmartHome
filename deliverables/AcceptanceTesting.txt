Introduction

        This document is the Acceptance Testing document for the HomeWatch
        application.

        It's purpose is to assist with installation of the system as
        well as giving the user some idea of how to achieve various
        goals in more detail than is available in the User Manual. This
        detail also lends itself towards aiding a user who is having
        difficulty working with the interface to locate the exact step
        at which their problem occurs, as well as allowing them to
        determine if the error is a matter of order of operations or
        a fault in the application itself. If an application fault is
        discovered the contacts provided in the Support Contact section
        can be used to alert the team in order to generate a solution
        to the fault. The intended audience of this document is the
        team involved with the installation and maintenance of the
        application, rather than those who use it for non work purposes
        or administration, although the System Tests section may be of
        some use to them if they cannot learn what they want from the
        User Manual.

Installation

        ###################################################################################
        DB First Time Installation:

        A) The user will need to have the Same table names as was
        provided by the client

        B) User will need to put the Air, Water, Heatflux, Energy and
        Water in one DB and the Bas tables should be in different
        one, in case the data or views needed to be accessed through
        phpmyadmin

        C) InstallDB.sh and DB.tar should be in the Same folder under the Script folder

        Website First Time Setup

        This installs the website assets such that it can be run from
        a server server running Apache 2 and PHP >= 5.4. In addition,
        git is needed to download and install PHP and JavaScript
        dependencies.

        A) Change directory to the repository root and run the
        first-time-setup.sh script. This will download and install
        the Composer PHP dependency manager. Additionally, this will
        initialize the git submodules for some JavaScript libraries.
        This is an entirely automated process.

        B) (Optional, not supported) Run the r.js optimizer with the
        build file in `www/js/app.build.js`. This will create a clone
        of the web root directory, `www`, called `build` and obfuscate
        the JavaScript files such that they use the least amount of
        bandwidth. Additionally, this combines JavaScript and CSS files
        such that they are transfered in the least amount of HTTP
        requests. r.js requires the node package manager.

        C) Now the www or build directory is the web document root. Set
        up of Apache is up to the discretion of the installer.

        CronJob Installtion:

        A) User will need to insert the username, password, db names in
        the Daily script shell script and config.php, in order to be
        executed by crontab.

        B) This cronjob for Daily update the views and tables for the DB
        overnight and allow the Weather.php to pull the data and store
        in the DB.

System Tests

        All tests need to be repeated for recent versions Firefox,
        Chrome and Internet Explorer Successful user registrations will
        cause future registrations of that username or email address to
        fail. Appending a number works for testing purposes.
