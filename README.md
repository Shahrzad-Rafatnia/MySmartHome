## Setup

**NEW**: Try `first-time-setup.sh`. The following explains what that
script does.

### PHP

We're using the [Composer][] dependency manager to automatically track
PHP library dependencies (for example, [PHPUnit][], [Twig][], plus any
other PHP libraries we may want). The link given should give you enough
information for how to setup Composer on your machine.  Essentially,
it's just:

```sh
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Then in  `www/` simply:

```sh
composer install --dev
```

To install all dependencies.

[PHPUnit]: http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html
[Twig]: http://twig.sensiolabs.org/

### JavaScript

JavaScript modules are cloned into `www/js/` using [git-submodules][].

The first time you pull, you must use:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

...to get the latest versions of all submodules. When somebody changes
the submodule version (you can check this using `git submodule status`),
you can update again using:

```sh
git submodule update
```

## PHP Tests

For now, I'm just dumping them all in the `test/` directory. Check out
`DummyTest.php` to give you the template for all of your unit tests.
Essentially, just include define a subclass of
`PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase`. To run it, you need the `phpunit`
exeucturable somewhere in your path. Then, you can simply run the test
in the command line (e.g.,  `phpunit tests/DummyTest.php`).

# EXPERIMENTAL: r.js

We can use [r.js][] to optimize the ENTIRE web site -- basically, it
merges and minifies a bunch of JavaScript and CSS. 

This would recreate the `www/` directory into a `build/` directory. 

It's kind of crazy, and I wouldn't recommend trying it right now, but
it's all set up and pretty nifty.

Simply do this in the root repository directory:

```sh
r.js -o www/js/app.build.js
```
And a _clone_ of the `www/` directory will be made called `build/`
that will contain all of the uglified JavaScript and CSS sources.
